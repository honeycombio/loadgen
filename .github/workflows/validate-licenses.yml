            We require all licenses of dependencies to be included.

            You should run `make update-licenses` locally to verify that all licenses are included and include
            the updated files in your PR.

            Once you update the repo, this workflow will re-run automatically and validate the updated title.

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.verifyLicenses.outputs.error_message }}
            ```
