# Release Process

1. Releases happen on main; merge your stuff there.
2. Create a new tag on the merged commit with the new version (e.g. `v1.4.1`).
3. Push the tag upstream (this will kick off the release pipeline in CI).
4. Once it lands, edit the draft release, hit the Generate Release Notes button, and save the release.
