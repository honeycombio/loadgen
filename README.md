# loadgen

**A flexible, Honeycomb-aware Telemetry load generator for traces**

## About

`loadgen` generates telemetry loads for performance testing, load testing, and
functionality testing. It allows you to specify the number of spans in a trace,
the depth (nesting level) of traces, the duration of traces, as well as the
number of fields in spans. It supports setting the number of traces per second
it generates, and can generate a specific quanity of traces, or run for a
specific amount of time, or both. It can also control the speed at which it
ramps up and down to the target rate.

It can generate traces in Honeycomb's proprietary protocol as well as all the
OTel-standard protocols, and it can send them to Honeycomb or any OTel agent.

For more information on why we felt we needed this, see [the Motivation section](#Motivation).

## Quickstart

You should have a recent version of Go installed.

Install:
```bash
go install github.com/honeycombio/loadgen
```

Get Usage information:
```bash
loadgen -h
```

Generate a single trace, 3 spans deep, and print it to the console:
```bash
go run . --sender=print --tracecount=1 --depth=3 --nspans=3
```

Send 3 traces to Honeycomb in the `loadtest` dataset, assuming you have an API key in the environment as HONEYCOMB_API_KEY:
```bash
loadgen --dataset=loadtest --tracecount=3
```

Send 100 traces per second for 10 seconds, with ramp times of 5 seconds. The traces will be 10 spans deep with 8 extra fields.
```bash
loadgen --dataset=loadtest --tps=100 --depth=10 --nspans=10 --extra=8 --runtime=10s --ramptime=5s
```

Send 10 traces per second for 10 seconds. The traces will be 4 spans deep with specific generated fields.
```bash
loadgen --dataset=loadtest --tps=10 --depth=4 --nspans=4 --runtime=10s product=/sa discount=/b20 price=/fg100,50
```

## Details

`loadgen` generates telemetry trace loads for performance testing. It can send
traces to honeycomb or to a local agent, and it can generate OTLP or
Honeycomb-formatted traces. It's highly configurable:

- `--depth` sets the depth (nesting level) of a trace.
- `--nspans` sets the number of spans in a trace.
- `--extra` sets the number of extra fields in a span beyond the standard ones.

If nspans is less than depth, the trace will be truncated at the depth of nspans.
If nspans is greater than depth, some of the spans will have siblings.

The names and types of all extra (random) fields will be consistent for a given
dataset, even across runs of loadgen so that datasets have longterm consistency.
Randomness is normally seeded by dataset name but if needed the seed can be set
to ensure consistency across multiple datasets.

You can also add specific fields with controllable values instead of letting loadgen
create random field names. See [Generators](#Generators).

Fields in a span will be randomly selected between a variety of types and ranges:
 - int or float (rectangular or gaussian, different ranges)
 - hex and alphabetic strings
 - boolean with various probabilities

In addition, every span will always have the following fields:
 - service name
 - trace id
 - span id
 - parent span id
 - duration_ms
 - start_time
 - end_time
 - process_id (the process id of the loadgen process)
 - goroutine_id (the ID of the goroutine producing that particular trace)

## Key adjustable values:

- `--tracetime` sets the average duration of a trace's root span; individual spans will be randomly assigned durations that will fit within the root spa--n's sets duration.
- `--runtime` sets the total amount of time to spend generating traces (0 means no limit).
- `--tps` (traces per second) sets the number of root spans to generate per second.
- `--tracecount` sets the maximum number of traces to generate; as soon as TraceCount is reached, the process stops (0 means no limit).
- `--ramptime` sets the duration to spend ramping up and down to the desired TPS.

All durations are expressed as sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a required unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

Functionally, the system works by spinning up a number of goroutines, each of which generates a stream of spans. The number of goroutines needed will equal `tracesPerSecond * Duration`.

Ramp up and down are handled only by increasing or decreasing the number of goroutines.

To mix different kinds of traces, or send traces to multiple datasets, use multiple loadgen processes.

## Generators

After the list of options, loadgen permits a list of fields in the form of name=constant or name=/gen.
Constant can be any value that doesn't start with a / -- numbers, strings, bools.

A constant is first attempted to be parsed as a bool, then an int, then a float.
Only if it fails all of those is it considered a string.

If the value starts with a /, it indicates a generator.

A generator is controlled by a single letter indicating the type of the field
generator, followed by a (possibly empty) option flag, followed by one or two
optional numeric parms (parameters) separated by a comma if the flag requires
more than one.

|type|description|p1|p2|
|----|---------|-|---|
|i, ir| rectangularly distributed integers | min (0)| max (100)|
|ig | gaussian integers | mean (100)| stddev (10)|
|f, fr| rectangularly distributed floats | min (0)| max (100) |
|fg | gaussian floats | mean (100)| stddev (10)|
|s, sa| alphabetic string | length in chars (16)||
| sw | pronounceable words | cardinality (16)||
| sx | hexadecimal string | length in chars (16)||
|b | boolean | percentage true (50) ||

### Examples
	* name=/s -- name is a string chosen from a list of words, cardinality is 16
	* name=/sx32 -- name is a string of 32 random hex characters
    * name=/sw12 -- name is pronounceable words with field cardinality 12
	* name=/i100 -- name is an int chosen from a range of 0 to 100
	* name=/ig50,30 -- name is an int chosen from a gaussian distribution with mean 50 and stddev 30
	* name=/f-100,100 -- name is a float chosen from a range of -100 to 100

## Motivation

We wanted a fast, easy-to-control tool that can send large quantities of traces
of variable shape, using either Honeycomb or OpenTelemetry.

The exact content of the traces isn't that important, but it is important to be
able to control it in a variety of ways. We wanted to be able to send simple
spans, or complex, deeply-nested traces, or shallow-but-wide traces. We wanted
to be able to control the number of fields in a trace, but we don't want them to
be purely random, but to have consistent datatypes and content shape.

We wanted to be able to send large volumes of traces to do load testing. That
also includes being able to ramp up and ramp down the volume at predictable
rates.

And we wanted it to be easy to install and use on a variety of platforms without
a lot of fiddling.

There were alternatives:

* The OTel telemetrygen tool only generates very simple traces and doesn't support Honeycomb format directly.
* The Locust load testing tool is very controllable, but requires installing Python and a virtual environment, and while it's fairly straightforward to generate Honeycomb trace data, it's much harder to make it do OpenTelemetry.
* Honeycomb has several internal tools designed to demonstrate the breadth and variety of our libraries, but they don't have a lot of control over their output and require setting up a complex set of containers.

In short, none of these met most of the goals, so a new tool seemed justified.
